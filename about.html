          About Me
        </h1>
        <p>My name is Kyleen Freeman.
          I am a Kennesaw State University student
          working towards my bachelor of science in
           Information Technology. This is my fourth 
           year at KSU, and I am expected to 
           graduate in fall 2026. My recent
            achievements include the presidents 
            list in fall 2024 and fall 2024. My
             current GPA is 3.20 and I have recently 
             declared my concentration in data 
             analytics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Originally I am from Columbus, GA.
           I graduated from Northside High School 
           in 2021 with a 3.8 GPA. I have always
            had an interest in computers and
             formatting. I did courses like Intro 
             to Business and Technology, Marketing 
             Principles, Principals of Marketing, 
             and Yearbook 1-4. All of these were a
              major foot in the door that taught me 
              about my enjoyment of Information 
              Technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have worked a few part-time jobs 
          in high school and college, all
           teaching me skills like leadership, 
           time management, and customer service.
           These jobs also gave a good list of refrerences.
            I hope to get an internship within the
             IT field this summer to help me get a 
             foot in the door for getting a 
             full-time position after graduation. 
             Throughout my time at KSU so far I
              have learned skills like Java,
               Python, HTML, CSS, and project
                management. I am currently 
                learning about SQL, ER, NER 
                diagrams, and javascript.
